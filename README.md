# Self-Driving-Guidance
This is a course project for Deep Learning Course, 2019 @ johns hopkins university. This repository presents a system approach
to generate driving strategies only based on RGB camera input. The whole system is divided into road segmentation,
car-detection and depth estimation with popular deep neural network architecture.

## Reference
Depth Estimation based on RGB input: https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth

Road Segmentation: VGG16 + FCN

Car Detection: YoLo v3 https://github.com/SKYSHAW1996/keras-yolo3-improved
